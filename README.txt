My 3D world incorporates both pathfinding and unaligned collision avoidance. The models were made and textured by me, and the ice/snow textures were made from pictures of ice and snow found through a Google search. The penguins follow two different paths- three loop around the ice in circles, and three weave around the ice. The third person controller is also a penguin. There is unaligned collision detection between the penguins following the path, but not the third person controller.
